# Router Brute Force Chrome v2.0 - Project Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a Chrome-based router brute force tool that opens a visible browser and tests default credentials sequentially, exactly as requested.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Chrome-Based Automation
- Uses Selenium WebDriver with Chrome browser
- Opens browser visibly by default (can run headless with `--headless`)
- Cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS

### ✅ Sequential Credential Testing
Tests exactly 4 credentials in order as specified:
1. `admin:admin`
2. `admin:support180`
3. `support:support`
4. `user:user`

### ✅ Screenshot Capture
- Takes screenshots of all login attempts
- Saves successful logins with timestamp
- Creates organized screenshot directory structure

### ✅ English Interface
- All messages, output, and documentation in English
- Professional console output with color coding
- Clear status messages and progress indicators

### ✅ Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Automatic ChromeDriver detection
- Platform-specific path handling

## Files Created

### Core Files
- `router_brute_force_chrome.py` - Main tool (Chrome-based version)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Setup & Testing
- `setup.py` - Automated setup script
- `test_tool.py` - Test suite (8/8 tests passed)
- `example_usage.py` - Usage examples and interactive mode

### Platform Launchers
- `run_windows.bat` - Windows batch launcher
- `run_linux.sh` - Linux/macOS shell launcher

### Documentation
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## How It Works

1. **Initialize Chrome**: Opens Chrome browser visibly
2. **Navigate to URL**: Goes to specified router login page
3. **Detect Form**: Automatically finds username/password fields
4. **Test Credentials**: Tests each credential set sequentially:
   - Fills form fields
   - Clicks submit or presses Enter
   - Analyzes page content for success
5. **Screenshot**: Captures all attempts
6. **Report**: Shows which credentials worked

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 router_brute_force_chrome.py -u http://192.168.1.1
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Custom timeout
python3 router_brute_force_chrome.py -u http://192.168.1.1 --timeout 15

# Headless mode
python3 router_brute_force_chrome.py -u http://192.168.1.1 --headless

# Custom screenshot directory
python3 router_brute_force_chrome.py -u http://192.168.1.1 --screenshot-dir my_screenshots
```

### Platform-Specific Launchers
```bash
# Windows
run_windows.bat

# Linux/macOS
./run_linux.sh
```

## Success Detection

The tool determines login success by analyzing:
- Page content for admin panel indicators (30+ patterns)
- URL changes from login page
- Presence of router management elements
- Absence of login form elements

## Screenshots

Creates organized screenshots:
- `initial_page_[username]_[password].png` - Initial page load
- `success_[username]_[password].png` - Successful login
- `failed_[username]_[password].png` - Failed attempt

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Module imports
- ✅ Credential definitions
- ✅ Class initialization
- ✅ URL parsing
- ✅ Form detection
- ✅ Success detection
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Selenium availability

## Security Notice

This tool is for authorized security testing only:
- Only test routers you own
- Only test with explicit permission
- Use in controlled lab environments
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.7+
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install ChromeDriver for your platform
4. Run: `python3 router_brute_force_chrome.py -u [URL]`

## Original vs New Version

### Original (`router_brute_force.py`)
- Uses requests library
- Headless operation
- Complex authentication detection
- Multiple authentication types

### New (`router_brute_force_chrome.py`)
- Uses Chrome browser (visible)
- Sequential credential testing
- Simple form-based detection
- Screenshot capture
- Focused on 4 specific credentials

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Chrome-based automation
- ✅ Visible browser operation
- ✅ Sequential credential testing
- ✅ 4 specific credentials tested
- ✅ Screenshot capture
- ✅ Cross-platform support
- ✅ English interface
- ✅ Professional documentation
- ✅ Testing and validation

The tool is ready for use and meets all specified requirements.
